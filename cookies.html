    <h2>What Are Cookies?</h2>
    <p>As is common practice with almost all professional websites, this site uses cookies, which are tiny files that are downloaded to your computer to improve your experience. This page describes what information they gather, how we use it, and why we sometimes need to store these cookies. We will also share how you can prevent these cookies from being stored, however, this may downgrade or 'break' certain elements of the site's functionality.</p>
    <p>Cookies can be "Persistent" or "Session" cookies. Persistent cookies remain on your personal computer or mobile device when you go offline, while Session cookies are deleted as soon as you close your web browser.</p>

        <li>To ensure the security and performance of the website.</li>

            <strong>Google AdSense:</strong> We use Google AdSense to serve advertising. The Google AdSense service uses a DoubleClick cookie to serve more relevant ads across the web and limit the number of times that a given ad is shown to you.

            <strong>Cloudflare:</strong> We use Cloudflare for website hosting, security, and performance.
